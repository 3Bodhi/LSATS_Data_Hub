Description=LSATS Bronze Ingestion - Document Sources (weekly)
# Suggested cadence: monthly — lab awards and KeyConfigure exports are provided manually
# Only runs usefully when new files have been dropped into DATA_PATH (/var/lib/lsats/data/)
# Consider: trigger manually after new files are placed rather than on a schedule
