Description=LSATS Bronze Ingestion - TeamDynamix (weekly)
# Suggested cadence: weekly — TDX ticket/asset/user data updated frequently
# Note: enrichment scripts (010+) make per-record API calls and may be slow for large datasets
# Consider: separate timer for ingest (001-003) vs enrich (010+) if enrichment is too slow
