Description=LSATS Silver Transformation (weekly)
# Suggested cadence: weekly, scheduled after the bronze ingestion window
# Timer is set independently from bronze timers — ensure silver runs after all
# bronze groups have had time to complete (bronze groups run Sun at 02:00,
# silver runs Sun at 04:00 to allow a 2-hour bronze window)
# Consider: OnUnitActiveSec approach if tighter dependency is needed
